### :book: NTHU Thesis Template :book:
This repositoty contains the official template used to write your NTHU thesis. It contains a series of examples 
on how to place figures, tables, equations, and many other important components of a research paper. 
The Table of contents and Figure Summary are automatically generated. These files are useful for those who use 
local desktop applications like [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/). If you are using online tools like 
Sharelatex, then this other [template](https://github.com/IDEA-NTHU-Taiwan/NTHU_thesis_template) might be more useful.
